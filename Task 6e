  Scenario: Searching for products by category
    Given there are products in the "Electronics" category
    And there are products in the "Clothing" category
    When I request to list all products in the "Electronics" category
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should contain only products from the "Electronics" category
    And the list should include the product with name "Laptop"
    And the list should include the product with name "Smartphone"
    And the list should not include any products from the "Clothing" category
