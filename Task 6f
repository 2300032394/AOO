    Given there are products that are available
    And there are products that are unavailable

    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should contain only available products
    And the list should include the product with name "Laptop"
    And the list should include the product with name "Smartphone"
    And the list should not include the product with name "T-Shirt"
