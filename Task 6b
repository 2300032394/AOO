  Scenario: Updating a product by its ID
    Given there is a product with ID "1" in the database
    When I update the product with ID "1" with the following details:
      | name       | Laptop Pro |
      | category   | Electronics |
      | price      | 1200.00 |
      | is_available | true |
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the product name should be "Laptop Pro"
    And the product category should be "Electronics"
    And the product price should be "1200.00"
    And the product availability should be "true"
